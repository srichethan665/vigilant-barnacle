Write a C programme which creates two child processes. Accept two values (1. Starting angle and ending angle in degrees) from user. First child should calculate the Sine value of the entered angle and display it. The second child should calculate the cosine of the value entered and display it. Both child processes should write these values in to shared memory. Once these two calculations are over and child processes wrote the contents to the shared memory, parent should calculate the tangent of the entered value using the results provided by the two child processes. Use proper mechanisms to ensure parent doesnâ€™t execute the calculation before child processes complete
